# Connector domain

## What a connector is

A connector is a public integration contract family that a workflow relies on.

## What a connector owns

Connector owns:
- namespace;
- shared bootstrap;
- family-level prerequisites;
- shared runtime context;
- operation registry.

## What an operation is

An operation is a concrete public operation within a connector family.

For connector operations, it is important to distinguish at least two operation kinds:
- `probe` — observes the world and returns structured observations without intended side effects;
- `action` — performs an effectful operation and returns a structured summary of its effects.

An operation contract must define:
- inputs;
- prerequisites;
- effects;
- outputs;
- failure modes.

## Explainability and result discipline

Every connector operation must:
- return a structured result both on success and on failure;
- be able to explain its outcome locally within its narrow semantic domain;
- preserve the result contract even under an internal exception.

Implications:
- a `probe` must return not only an outcome but also meaningful observations and diagnostics;
- an `action` must return not only an outcome but also an effect summary and diagnostics;
- raw stdout/stderr, when produced by an operation, are supplementary detail fields rather than the basis of the contract.

## Bootstrap

A connector may have shared bootstrap or shared context for the whole family.

Examples:
- `gh` checks binary availability, auth, and required scopes at the family level;
- `gh.issue.view` checks its own local contract;
- `shell` defines supported interpreter policy, while `shell.command` executes a concrete command.

## Publicness

`connectors/` is a public and stable layer.

Implications:
- connector and operation names matter;
- family-level semantics matter;
- the meaning of a same-named operation must not change silently.

## Fixed v0 connector domains

- `git.*`
- `gh.*`
- `shell.*`

## Possible future connector namespaces

- `run.*`
- `ansible.*`
- `fs.*`
- `obsidian.*`

## Local extension namespaces

- `local.*`
- `project.*`
